                Once upon a time, King Unnamed of Nowhereland was both smiling and crying at the same time. He was
                smiling
                because his enormous brand-new palace with many spacious rooms and corridors has just been finished. He
                is
                also crying as these rooms need to be illuminated and kept warm, but the ongoing increase of utility
                costs
                affect him as well. So now it's time to think about the placement of the palace's light bulbs. We need
                to
                place them so that everything is properly lit, but we cannot install any unnecessary bulbs. You can
                start the game
                by choosing one of the maps (according to their difficulty) You can save, load or refresh your game by
                pressing
                the according buttons. Once one map is generated, this text will disappear and your map will come to the
                screen. The game has
                autosaving feature, whenever you place a lightbulb the game saves it for you, so you don't need to worry
                about losing your progress. You can also see your old progress by pressing the load button.
                Good Luck!</strong></p>
